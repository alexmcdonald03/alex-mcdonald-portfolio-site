About Me
Alex McDonald during his academic exchange with Mediterranean coastal cityscape background
Hi, I'm Alex McDonald- a strategic communicator and soon-to-be graduate from Carleton University with a BA in Communication & Media Studies (graduating December 2025).

I recently completed an academic exchange in Vienna, where I deepened my global perspective on media, marketing, and storytelling. Before that, I worked with Red Bull, supporting product sell-in and marketing activations across 500+ retail accounts in Ontario. That experience sharpened my skills in brand execution, strategic storytelling, and relationship-building, and taught me how to bring a brand to life at scale.

I'm passionate about crafting communication strategies that connect, engage, and deliver measurable results, with authenticity and sustainability at the core. Now, I'm excited to bring my blend of real-world experience and fresh perspective to a full-time role in strategic communications, marketing, or sales, ideally within a fast-moving, mission-driven team.
